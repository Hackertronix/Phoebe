# Phoebe
Project Phoebe is the first step toward mutative design - a new design methodology that would allow interfaces to be born and evolve like living things according to a user's reality.

It's an idea that looks to solve the problem of designing for averages, and create interfaces that account for all users.

The files here include design resources used in the examples at [hello.phoebe.xyz](http://hello.phoebe.xyz) and the source code for Selene, the first mutative sample app. Join the beta at [selene.phoebe.xyz](http://selene.phoebe.xyz)
